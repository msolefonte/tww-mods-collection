# Norsca: Loot & Raze for the Gods

Want to support my work? Feel free to donate via

Norscan factions have a really bad economy and you need to loot a lot to have a
decent income but you still need to raze to destroy your enemies. This is the
way to do both with just one click. I hope you love it.

There is an alternative version to separate the raze from the Gods mechanic. If
you want to take a look to it, just move here: [Norsca: Loot & Raze](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1118362434).

It should be compatible with anything, but feel free to report any bug or
problem.
