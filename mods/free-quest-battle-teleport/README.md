Sometimes having to teleport by 4500 when the mission is going to give 5000 not
only does not contribute but is annoying. Tired of having to pay barbarities for
not losing two shifts? This mod is the solution and is born with the idea that
all teleport is now free.

If you are looking for something different there is an alternative version
called [Impossible Quest Battle Teleport](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1118164395)
in which teleport is impossible for all missions.

Both mods are compatible with [Instant Quest Battles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=808802871)
and [Instant Monster Hunting](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1110660391)
and should not have any compatibility problems except with other mods that do
the same.
