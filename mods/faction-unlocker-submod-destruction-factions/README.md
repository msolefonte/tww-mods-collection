I'm a really lover of Crynsos' Faction Unlocker+ but I wanted a submod to play
with all the factions. I tried to do it but there is a limitation of visible
factions on the campaing selector, so I decided to make two mods, this one for
the order factions and [Faction Unlocker Submod - Destruction Factions](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1105739137) for the
destruction ones. For additional campaigns (DLC) all factions are available in
both mods. Both unlockers are independent and will not work together.

This mod unlocks:
-All provinces from the Empire
-All factions from Dwarfs
-All factions from Wood Elves
-All provinces from Bretonia
-Kislev and Erengrad
-Tilea, Estalia and Border Princes

I recommend to play with the same mods than Crysnos, but I want especial
attention to [TEB](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=708051537)
and [Kraka Drak](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765204760)
from Cataph and [Mixu's Legendary Lords](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904487915).
The best ones for me. These mods don't affect to this user available campaigns
but are still funny and good to see on the map.

For any problems or questions, just comment it.

All credits to Crynsos who without his mod and the guide he made available to
other modders, this mod will not be there.
