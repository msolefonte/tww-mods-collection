# Norsca: Loot & Raze

I love the new mechanical of Raze for a Chaos God added to Norsca, but what if I
don't want it for a God? Can't I be an atheist? That's racist! Well, the main
thing I wanted to change is the need to keep razing for a Chaos God when you are
already allied with one of them. Why keep razing? For the Glory of Khorne of
course. Nope.

Norscan factions have a really bad economy and you need to loot a lot to have a
decent income but you still need to raze to destroy your enemies. This is the
way to do both with just one click. I hope you love it.

There is an alternative version to integrate the raze to the Gods mechanic. If
you want to take a look to it, just move here: [Norsca: Loot & Raze for the Gods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1118471309).

It should be compatible with anything, but feel free to report any bug or
problem.
