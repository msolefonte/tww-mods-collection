**THIS MOD IS OBSOLETE. KRELL IS NOT A LORD ANYMORE IN CFU+**

Well, a lot of people is complaining about Crynsos decision to make Krell a
lord. I don't have any problem with that but I love options, so this mod allows
you to play him like in Vanilla. Obviously the mod requires CFU+.

I can't change the start positions thought, so he is still going to be a Lord if
you start with Mousillon but you can just kill him in a battle. Once you have
killed him (I'm starting to feel bad) he is not going to be able anymore. The
ability to invoke him is able from the start and now works the same way than
the vanilla one. If you find some bug or something just report it.

Thanks a lot to Crynsos for his amazing mod.
