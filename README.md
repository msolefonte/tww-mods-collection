# Collection of mods for Total War: Warhammer

Years ago, in 2017, I was a huge fan of Total War: Warhammer and decided to
support the community by developing a set of mods that I shared for free at
the Steam Workshop. Three years later, some of these mods have more than five
thousand active users, having been the total userbase of them of more than
one hundred thousand of users.

Now, I decided to collect all of them and publish them here, on GitHub. some
or them might be obsolete or not useful anymore, but I am sure they can be
helpful for anyone that wants to check how they were done and what did they
modify. They are shared as binaries in their `.pack` format, but you can use
the standard modding tools to extract all their changes.

In the future, I am planning to port some of these mods to Total War: Warhammer
II and Total War: Warhammer III as long as I feel that they are still required.
I have also some new mods in mind, for these and other games, so perhaps my
career as modder keeps growing.

This is complete list of the mods here shared and their Steam Workshop page:
